Macro11_Parser

-Scan the entire line in mainline, pass as vector to parser object
-Pass compound token values as vector to parser object
-Everytime parser encounters a compound token it calls a screener function
which may change the token value and can provide further data (ex. opcode type)
at the same time.

input:
//from scanner

output:
//assembled statments

parse:				// will exist in mainline (not as parser object)
